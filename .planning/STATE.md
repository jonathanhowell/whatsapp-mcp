## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- — see PROJECT.md for pending key decisions
- [Phase 01]: Used smol-toml@1.6.1 for TOML parsing (actively maintained ESM+CJS library)
- [Phase 01]: tsconfig module: Node16 required for @modelcontextprotocol/sdk ESM import paths
- [Phase 01]: refreshSnapshot does not call cleanOldSnapshots — refresh overwrites snapshot in-place rather than cleaning on each refresh

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: macOS Sequoia TCC behavior for Claude Code's `disclaimer` wrapper is partially documented; may require empirical testing to confirm the exact Full Disk Access grant path
- Phase 1: Live DB vs snapshot default — concrete implementation decision needed (recommendation: `db.backup()` from a read-only connection)
- Phase 3: FTS5 index covers only ~4,711 of 22,892 messages — LIKE fallback is mandatory, not optional; root cause unknown
