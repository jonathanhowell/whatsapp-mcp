### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: macOS Sequoia TCC behavior for Claude Code's `disclaimer` wrapper is partially documented; may require empirical testing to confirm the exact Full Disk Access grant path
- Phase 1: Live DB vs snapshot default — concrete implementation decision needed (recommendation: `db.backup()` from a read-only connection)
- Phase 3: FTS5 index covers only ~4,711 of 22,892 messages — LIKE fallback is mandatory, not optional; root cause unknown
